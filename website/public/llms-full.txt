## Medical disclaimer (important)

Pelvisana content is educational. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Users should seek clinical care for red flags (e.g., pelvic pain, unexplained bleeding, fever, recent surgery complications) or individualized assessment.

## Evidence approach

Pelvisana summarizes and translates high-quality sources into actionable, understandable guidance. PFMT is commonly recommended as a first-line conservative option for urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in many guidelines and systematic reviews.
