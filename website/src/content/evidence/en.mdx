## What we mean by “evidence-based”

Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is commonly recommended in clinical guidelines as a first-line conservative option for symptoms such as urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Evidence does not guarantee the same outcome for every person, but it helps us choose what’s most likely to be helpful and safe.

## What PFMT is (and isn’t)

PFMT is a structured program to **train pelvic floor muscles through repeated contractions and relaxations**, typically progressed over time. It is not just “doing Kegels whenever you remember”—technique and consistency matter.

If you have pelvic pain, suspected muscle overactivity, or you’re not sure you’re contracting correctly, professional assessment can be important.

## What research and guidelines broadly support

- **Urinary incontinence:** PFMT is widely recommended as a first-line conservative option for many women with stress and mixed urinary incontinence.
- **Pelvic organ prolapse symptoms:** PFMT is frequently recommended as a conservative option, especially in mild-to-moderate presentations.
- **Adherence:** Many people struggle with consistency; reminders, clear programs, and tracking can support adherence.

## Safety notes

Stop and seek clinical advice if PFMT causes pain, new/worsening symptoms, unexplained bleeding, fever, or if you have specific medical conditions requiring individualized guidance.
